## Usage

 1. Main script

    PubChemCID_to_3Dprint.py

  2. Install Incentive [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/) program

  3. Set the permissions and make sure that in the script the path to the executable file is correct (depends on the operating system)

    app_to_open_with = "executable_file"

**macOS**

    /Applications/PyMOL.app/Contents/MacOS/PyMOL

**Windows**
to be specified

**Ubuntu**
to be specified

  4. Use [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) to Scale up the molecules and set the colours for multicolour printing
